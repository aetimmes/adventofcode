# 2017 solutions

I completed the 2017 solutions in early January 2022 and December 2023 in between AoC 2023 problems.

Because so much time passed in between starting and finishing, I don't really have any coherent organized thoughts. I _think_ I kept track of the bugs I wrote in the earlier days, but completely forgot during the ones I solved in 2023. (I think this gets less useful as the problems get harder and as my skeleton gets better at alerting me to incorrect example submissions before I submit.)
